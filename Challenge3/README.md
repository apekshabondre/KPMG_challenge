Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you. Example Inputs object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}} key = a/b/c object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}} key = x/y/z value = a
We would like to see some tests.

Solution:
A python script is created for the given problem as "get_value.py".
The code following parameters as input:
    1. object 
    2. key 

The script "test_function.py" performs unittest on the script.
